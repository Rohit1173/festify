# festify-android
An app for easing managing and registering for fests, events and workshops.

#### Problem Statement:
-------------------------------------------------
Many institutions and organizations have been continuously facing issues while organizing fests and events for properly managing invitations and registrations and it has been equally painful for people willing to attend these events to find where to register and then filling those lengthy traditional forms.  Itâ€™s a tough job to collect the data of people who are interested in attending an event.
Sometimes due to unforeseen circumstances some people might need to cancel their registration for the event and then it becomes difficult for the organizers to update their systems and plan.
Possible interested attendees may miss out on some event due to lack of information or even may forget about it considering how busy life on an individual is these days.

#### Proposed Solution:
-------------------------------------------------
This project aims to minimize the hassle and ease the process for people willing to organize and attend some events. People willing to attend some events just have to sign up once filling their information and then not worry about filling different forms for different events. The application fetches list of updated events from the backend server and presents them to the user category wise, where they can choose some event which interests them and register for with just touch of a button. The application always maintains a list of events for which the user has registered already so they can manage their time accordingly. User also has an option to cancel registration for an event by just another touch. This greatly eases the process for people attending and also for the people organizing the event as they also can just fetch out the details of people registering for the event.
